# hello-world
I't a short descriptiopn I was told to write my GitHub Guides. I hope I'll get it later.

Now I was told to write down something about me. SOOOOOO I'm new to this place and it's a bit scary, cause I still don't get a lot. But I need to understand all of this to be closer to my developers team. I think I'am gonna spend some productive time here.
